      <h1>Cells of Anarchy</h1>

      <h2>On Free and open-source software (FOSS)</h2>

      <h3>One of many ways of seeing reality</h3>

      <p>
         The principles behind Cells of Anarchy applies equally to closed-source project and open-source projects alike.
         If you're currently working with a group of FOSS-developers and you're a large group, consider splitting
         functional areas and
         reducing the size of your teams.
      </p>

      <p>
         Being a small team can be very positive to productivity, but it is even more productive being a sole developer.
         When you are a sole developer, decisions can be made without any wasted time or energy that often comes along
         by
         involving multiple parties.
      </p>

      <p>
         A lot of open-source projects are driven by sole individuals who have a passion to deliver a creation of their
         own minds. Initially a lot of these projects are very productive and they often innovate in areas that existing
         libraries and software have stagnated.
      </p>

      <p>
         Unfortunately too many of these projects fails to capture a community of contributors. I have previously built
         software that relies on FOSS libaries, only to experience that the primary maintainers ends up abandoning their
         projects. This is often a very natural result of FOSS, it is primarily driven by passion and not for economic
         gains.
      </p>

      <p>When the primary maintainer disappears, it does not help with financial support to get them back. I have seen
         examples where companies have offered money, but the offers has been declined.</p>

      <p>
         Successful projects ends up being adopted by commercial interests and community that is able to fund
         projects, either directly with a monetary value, or indirectly with development resources.
      </p>

      <p>
         There is millions of FOSS projects and many differ greatly in how they organize the development. What applies
         to the Linux kernel, does not always apply to a project with few maintainers. The principles of human
         behavior and limitations does apply everywhere.
      </p>

      <h3>What is FOSS?</h3>

      <p>
         From Wikipedia: "<em>Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free
            software
            and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in
            any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the
            design
            of the software.</em>"
      </p>

      <p>
         The latter part of this description, is the essential difference between FOSS and other styles of licensing
         software. Anyone outside of the main development team, is and should be encouraged to voluntarily improve the
         existing software.
      </p>

      <p>
         This is primarily done through the submission of Pull Requests (PR).
      </p>

      <p>
         Often contributions comes from developers who adopt a software (often in the form of a library) and they have
         some additional needs and expansions to the (yours) library, or they have discovered a bug and need it to be
         fixed in
         the official distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
         Other times the requests comes from users, who do not have the ability to code. A lot of larger projects use
         seperate systems for taking user feedback, and keep their DevOps tooling, such as Gitlab and GitHub, for
         issues and features that have been accepted as something valuable to proceed with.
      </p>

      <p>
         Before making a pull request to the source code repository of a project, a developer will make a fork (copy) of
         the source code where they can make changes, hack, test and experiment without affecting anyone else. When the
         changes to the code has been finalized, a pull request can be initiated and sent to the original repository
         where it can be reviewed for changes and finally merged, or discarded.
      </p>

      <p>
         Often times these PRs comes out of no-where. This is the nature of software development. Some developers in a
         different country has a special edge case usage of your library that you never anticipated. The developer took
         the time to debug and fix the problem, and they provide you with a ready-made solution. Sometimes they first
         communicate by reporting an issue or bug, sometimes not.
      </p>

      <p>
         This is the time you should cheer and congratulate the individual who submitted a pull request. By taking on an
         open-source project, you also take on the responsibility of the community around you. That means you should
         treat any and all pull requests as gold. They are your most precious gift.
      </p>

      <p>
         Many PRs probably don't make sense, and sometimes it might be the correct path forward to insist that the
         developer go ahead and continue on their own path. This is something that should be avoided as hard as
         possible and be a last resort.
      </p>

      <p>
         In my own experience, I have often received feedback to simply "fork and maintain" my own versions of the
         library. This is very bad, for many reasons.
      </p>

      <p>It is bad for security, it is bad for quality, it is bad for community and overall it is bad for human
         progress. Overall it's much more preferable to keep the majority of work and contributions to the official
         repository.</p>

      <p>
         What has made FOSS successful, is the long tail of user contributions in combination with experienced
         maintainers. Without either, most projects will eventually fail. If you don't have someone experienced, then it
         is hard to maintain quality and productivity over time. Without the community and contributions, you're also
         not going to gain all the benefits from being open-source.
      </p>

      <p>
         One of the greatest feelings, is having random strangers helping you on improving your own software. That
         feeling when the pull request is finally merged, is amazing. A lot of effort goes into software development,
         and being able to delegate some of the work and responsibility, is very rewarding.
      </p>
