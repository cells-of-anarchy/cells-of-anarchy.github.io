      <h2>Radical Software Development Process for High Performance Continuous Delivery</h2>

      <h3>What it is</h3>

      <p>
         "<strong>Cells of Anarchy</strong>" is an opinionated process (<em>"a series of actions or steps taken in order
            to
            achieve a
            particular
            end."</em>) that attempts to optimize the end of becoming high performance teams that does continuous
         delivery
         of
         software.
      </p>

      <p>
         DISCLAIMER: This process is not for everyone. Read it, learn it, adopt it, evolve it.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
         If you are currently unsatisfied with the performance of your own ability, or your teams ability, to deliver
         software, consider adopting
         the process of <strong>Cells of Anarchy</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
         In many ways this is a radical departure from traditional software development processes
         (principles/practices),
         which
         does not focus on delivery, but rather ceremony, reporting and management.
      </p>

      <p>Too much focus has been on frameworks such as Scrum, but these are extremely basic and lacking any software
         principles or practices. It is not optimized to enable teams to work on complex and mentally challenging tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
         The <strong>Cells of Anarchy</strong> process stands behind <a
            href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">Twelve Principles of Agile Software</a>
         and through the opinioated and defined process,
         realizes these principles.
      </p>

      <p>While other development processes might result in some adoption of the principles, the <strong>Cells of
            Anarchy</strong> process
         supercharges the teams ability to successfully adopt the principles.</p>

            the teams (Cells) to concentrate on the product development.

      <h3><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h3>

      <p>1. Common purpose. The single most important ingredient in team success is a clear, common, and compelling
         purpose. Too often, a team’s purpose is ill-defined, uninspiring, or foggy, leaving the team to figure out what
         success is supposed to look like. Teams are merely a means to an end — a method of achieving desired outcomes
         that
         are too big to reach through individual efforts; they are not the end itself.  And it is team purpose that
         provides the reason for collaboration. A clear, compelling purpose gives reason for people to commit to a team.
         A
         common purpose not only calls the team together, it also holds the team together during the inevitable
         turbulence
         that will be experienced on the journey.
         The power of a team flows from the alignment of each member to the purpose. Creating this alignment is one of
         the
         most important roles of leadership. Misaligned teams are often a clear indicator of poorly led teams. There are
         five key criteria essential for team alignment:
         •    Clear: I see it. The benefits of team effort are understood by everyone.•    Relevant: I want it. Team
         purpose and goals align to individual goals and interests.•    Significant: It’s worth it. Team objectives are
         of
         sufficient magnitude to make the work worth the effort.•    Achievable: I believe it. Everyone believes the
         team
         purpose is realistic and attainable.•    Urgent: I want it … now! A sense of timeliness drives behavior.
         The above is straightforward. However, aligning to a common purpose is harder than it looks. A common mistake
         is
         to launch the team too quickly and push them into implementation before members have had the opportunity to
         coalesce around a purpose and ensure that everyone is aligned to it.
         In short: No team purpose, no team.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="communication">Communication</a></h3>

      <p>
         <strong>Excellent communication.</strong> Communication is the very means of cooperation. One of the primary
         motives of companies choosing to implement teams is that team-based organizations are more responsive and move
         faster. A team cannot move faster than it communicates. Fast, clear, timely, accurate communication is a
         hallmark
         of high levels of team performance. High-performance teams have mastered the art of straight talk; there is
         little
         motion wasted through misunderstanding or confusion. The team understands that effective communication is
         essential, and as a result, they approach communication with a determined intentionality. They talk about it a
         lot
         and put effort into keeping excellent team communication.
         You will notice that the team model now circles back to common purpose, the first characteristic of a
         high-performance team. The connection is intentional, for a team cannot maintain unity of purpose without
         exceptionally good communication among team members. Once a team loses its ability to communicate well and
         thereby
         understand one another, it quickly loses its sense of purpose. Confused communication and unity of purpose
         cannot
         coexist.
         When it comes to building high-performance teams, these six characteristics are the essential few.  If a team
         gets
         these things right, it will raise the probability of success and therefore achieve its desired outcomes.

         <strong>Open and Honest Communication</strong>
         A hallmark of the high performance team is a high level of open, honest, robust and transparent communication.
         High performance teams increase trust by building a culture of partnership and shared values.

         This starts with open and honest communication.

         <strong>When honesty and transparency are lacking there can be no trust.</strong>

         Without trust teams fail to solve problems or make decisions. Without trust teams are crippled by conflict.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="goals">Goals</a></h3>

      <p>Goals should be business KPIs that are clearly defined, achievable but also stretch goals to ensure team is
         performing and getting into flow-zone.</p>

      <h3><a name="team">Team</a></h3>

      <p>After the team has been set, it must be built through the continuous process of improvement. This means that
         the
         team can and should change, if the team does not work optimally. The end goal is team members who themselves
         understand that their fitness is not well for the team.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="decisions">Effective Decision Making</a></h3>

      <p>Being able to perform effective decision is essential for keep flow and productivity high in the team. Defined
         lines of responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
         Team must have continuous and immediate access and feedback from product owner. Product owner that is not
         available, should be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
         Fixing wrong output from wrong decisions CAN be faster than time spent on waiting for decision, but not always.
         Allow team to trust their judgement and avoid negative results from wrong decisions.

      <h3>Process Cycle</h3>

      <img class="image-full" src="assets/cell-process.png">

      <ol>
         <li>Product Owner, UX Designer, Architects work together with Customer/User to define the Functional
            Specification:

            <ol>
               <li>Functional Specification Document (FSD)</li>
               <li>Graphical User Interface sketches</li>
            </ol>

         </li>
         <li>
            Developers:

            <ol>
               <li>Pull task from backlog, minimize current active work (1 pr. developer)</li>
               <li>Make decisions or consult with product owner, which should always be available</li>
               <li>Work until deployed in production</li>
            </ol>

         </li>
         <li>
            Product Owner and stakeholders follows progress updates and continuously deliver feedback and re-prioritize
            the
            product backlog:

            <ol>
               <li>Product owner can schedule and plan meetings with customer/user at any interval that works well
               </li>
               <li>Product owner must ensure that customer/user have workshops and are made available to developers
                  throughout
                  the delivery
               </li>
            </ol>

         </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Notes: <em>The Product Owner, together with the UX Designer and architects (functional, business, technical)
            must
            sit together with customer/user and design the graphical user interface and define both the introductional
            and
            high-level Functional Specification Document. Additionally these roles must define the product backlog and
            keep
            it up-to-date on a daily basis.

            The developers should spend no time on estimation. No time on figuring out what task to perform next, other
            than picking a task that fits well for their level of expertise and knowledge. Developers should not pick
            too
            challenging tasks until the MVP has been delivered.

            Developers should make as many decisions as possible, but most decisions must be made in the UX work,
            functional specification and product back log items. Product Owner must be available for clarification all
            the
            time. There are no alternative to not having a product owner available at any time. If the product owner is
            not
            available, the process will fail. Developers won’t be able to complete their current tasks, which results in
            taking on other tasks, which again will lack clarification, and the individual tasks upon each team member
            grows and becomes a major bottleneck for high-performance.

            The only definition of done, is running code deployed to production. Team should not spend any time on
            definition any other definition of done. Deployment should be automated fully into production, no manual
            approval required. This means that the initial deployment must first go to a staging/integration environment
            for automated testing. A timed delay can be added, so to be able to stop the automated deployment if needed.

            If possible, deploy continuously to production. Use feature toggling to enable and disable functionality of
            the
            system. Ensure there are multiple levels of feature toggled access, the developers need to keep certain
            functionality hidden from the rest of the team, to avoid confusion and feedback on prototype and test
            functionality.

            The team should perform no estimation of the tasks. The team should perform no estimation of the business
            value
            of a task. The team should use common sense and critical thinking of the tasks align with the PURPOSE and
            GOAL
            of the product. If the task does not fit with PURPOSE and GOAL, take it up immediately with the product
            owner
            for clarification. The product owner have prioritized it high for a reason, so get clarification quickly.

            The product owner can schedule milestones, meetings, releases as much as they want, but this should not be
            communicate to the team. The team should never have any deadline, never, ever.

            The first tenant of the process, is QUALITY. There will no quality of delivery if there is any deadline for
            any
            delivery.

            The team will continuously deliver, and the product owner (and other stakeholders) can test and verify what
            functionality is complete and the quality of the functionality. Based on what is actually being delivered,
            they
            can schedule marketing events and release to customers at any phase that fits with the rest of organization
            and
            market.

      <h3><a name="noestimation">No Estimation</a></h3>

      <p>Estimation should not be used in any capacity in the cell.</p>

      <p>A lot of theory on estimation exists, refer to other sources on the value of No Estimation.</p>

      <p>The super cell can utilize experts for rough estimates (Rough Order of Magnitude) – they do not belong to the
         team, so team is not accountable</p>

      <p>Avoiding estimations is important to get quality in delivery – one cannot get both schedule and quality.</p>

      <h3><a name="marked">Market schedules and plans</a></h3>

      <p>The cells cannot deliver what it cannot deliver – market schedules should be based on reality of cell output.
      </p>

      <p>The company/marketing can independently organize market events and schedule for functionality availability for
         customers/user.</p>

      <p>
         End goal: All new functionality is done in good time before released to market.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="flow">Flow Zone</a></h3>

      <p>Important to utilize team members strengths and get everyone into the flow-zone.</p>

      <p>Everybody doesn’t need to know everything. If you are the best, you do it.</p>

      <p>Avoid too much challenge, and too much boredom. Too much challenge/learning hinders high performance.</p>

      <p>Balance is key and require a concious effort of the cell as a whole and the individual.</p>

      <h3><a name="constraints">Constraints</a></h3>

      <p>An absolute maximum of 10 team members, effectiveness will dwindle when larger.</p>

      <p>The teams are like cells, unless all functions is part of the team, the cell will be dysfunctional.</p>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>

      <p>Q: What about quality?</p>

      <p>A: Quality should not be a metric for the cell. If the cell is able to keep the members in the flow-zone, then
         quality will be the result of the output. Active, engaged and willing members of a cell will result in high
         quality output. Focus on quality will have deterimental effect on the actual quality.</p>
